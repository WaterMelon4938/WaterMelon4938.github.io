				This is my website that will serve as a dumping ground for the coming end of the age stuff. I have a stupid disorder called "ADHD", so it's very hard for me to focus and work on this website, so I have to force myself to get this done, but even then, it will still take me a while to get it to a point where I consider it complete (Some days my brain feels like soup though and I cannot think well). I do not take credit for the work done by Messiah 2030, escapeallthings, and Answers in Genesis. This website merely serves to show people these things.
