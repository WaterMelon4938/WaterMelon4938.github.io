    <dd><i>Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition</i> had the following differences from other editions:
		<ul>
		<li>This version lacked online multiplayer. Local ad-hoc multiplayer was added in update 1.4.</li>

		<li>World types were "Default" and "Flat." Default world sizes were Small (672×672), Medium (1344×1344), and Large (2016×2016). The size of a world wasn’t able to be changed once it was created. The ratio of the Nether to the Overworld is 1:3.</li>

		<li>Although the height limit was only 128 blocks, worlds could be larger than the Small world type from Legacy Console Edition.</li>

		<li>There was a mob cap that was much stricter than Legacy Console Edition, where a maximum of 24 enemies, 24 animals, 16 squid, and 16 villagers could exist at one time. However, there was initially no cap on experience orbs, so it was possible to crash the game by throwing too many bottles o' enchanting. This was fixed in update 1.1.</li>

		<li>Instead of including the map item, the map and the player's coordinates were displayed on the Touch Screen. Due to this, it was impossible to map The Nether in this version. The touch screen was also used for inventory management and crafting. The Woodland Mansion and Ocean Monument maps from update 1.9 were the only map items in the New Nintendo 3DS Edition. They did not display the map in the player’s hand, but rather is held in the hotbar, and was displayed on the map in the touch screen.</li>

		<li>This version targeted 60 frames per second in standard worlds and 30 frames per second in Mash-up worlds.</li>
